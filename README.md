# Lending Case Study - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Problem Statement
A consumer finance company must decide whether to approve loan applications based on applicant profiles, balancing two risks: losing business by rejecting creditworthy applicants and incurring financial losses by approving loans for those likely to default. The goal is to optimize loan approval decisions to minimize risks and maximize profitability. 

### Objectives
- Perform EDA to explore and understand the dataset.
- Identify key factors and patterns that correlate with loan defaults.
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing loan approval decisions.
